# 30 MINUTES OF PYTHON

Python is a dynamically typed programming language. Created by Guido Von Rossum back in 1990, Since then it has been improved with the release of python version 2, python2 in 2000 which gained much traction. In 2008 (3/12/2008) python3 was released.

*Python3 is not backward compatible with python2.*


WHY PYTHON
 - Cross Platform
 - Simple syntax
 - Concise
 - Interpreted language. (Code can be executed as soon as it is run).
 - can be run in a procedural, object-oriented or functional way.


WHAT CAN PYTHON DO
- create web applications on server-side
- connect to the database system
- Read and Modify files
- Handle big data and perform complex mathematics
- Rapid prototyping


Outline

- Intro to python
- Comments in python
- Python Syntax
- Variables and Constants
- Python Data types
- Simple Python Data Structures

### Python Literals
A literal is a raw given in a variable and constant. examples of python literals => Numeric, String, Boolean, None


A lambda function is a small anonymous function. Syntax: lambda *argument* : *expression*




### Lesson 1

- Operator precendence
- other operators => // floor division, ~ complement, >> right shift, << right shift
- Read about the left and right associativity.
- * / % => left-to-right associativity



in memory these are not stored as the same
